[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to open a note of your choice when creating a new tab, like in the browser. That's it, that's the plugin.

## Usage: 3 Steps
1. Set the note you want to load in new tabs in the settings. 
2. Open a new tab. 
3. There is no step 3.

- You can set it the new tab page to any file in your vault really, e.g. an image if you want to have a nice wallpaper as new tab page.
- Closing your last tab also redirects you to your new tab page.
- Whether the new note is opened in Reading Mode or Edit Mode is determined by the Obsidian setting `Editor → Default view for new tabs`. You can also force a different mode using the [Force View Mode Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-view-mode-by-frontmatter).

## Installation
Available in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser via: `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Browse` → Search for *"New Tab Default Page"*
